        What is this project?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Our World is just a hobby project, an excuse for me to learn more about the world we live in. I find it astonishing how around 65% of this planet is still undiscovered (considering the ocean takes up 71% of the surface), so I want to discover more piece by piece.

        What can I find on this website?
    </h3>
    <p>
        You can find information on the geological timescales, as well as some organisms containing information on when they lived, and what characteristics they have.
